const FAQS = [
  { q: "Are your fragrances original and authentic?", a: "Yes. Every perfume is sourced from authorised distributors and arrives factory-sealed. You can check the batch code on the box, and we accept returns on any item you believe is not genuine." },
  { q: "How do I order on WhatsApp?", a: "Tap the Order on WhatsApp button on any product. The message is pre-filled with the product name, size and page link — just press send. We reply with availability, total and payment options." },
  { q: "Which payment methods do you accept?", a: "MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money, cash on delivery, and cash or card when you pick up at our T2000 store. No account or card is required to order." },
  { q: "Do you deliver outside Kigali?", a: "We deliver anywhere in Kigali with zone-based fees, and pickup is always free at the store. For upcountry orders we can arrange bus-parcel delivery — contact us on WhatsApp." },
  { q: "How long does delivery take?", a: "Same day for orders confirmed before 3pm, next day otherwise. You receive an SMS or WhatsApp confirmation with the status of your order." },
  { q: "Can I return a perfume I do not like?", a: "Unopened and sealed items can be exchanged within 7 days. For opened fragrances we offer a store credit or an exchange of equal value — see our Returns page for details." },
  { q: "How long do your perfumes and oils last?", a: "Our Eau de Parfums typically last 6 to 10 hours depending on skin and weather. Concentrated roll-on oils last longer on pulse points — most customers get a full day from two dabs." },
  { q: "What is a custom blend and how does it work?", a: "You choose a base oil, two or three scent notes and a bottle size. We mix it in store, label it with your name, and save it so you can reorder the exact same blend later." },
  { q: "Can I book a blending session?", a: "Yes — use the booking form on the Custom Blends page to request a date and time. Sessions are free, take about 30 minutes, and there is no obligation to buy." },
  { q: "Do you have gift sets?", a: "Yes. We offer perfume + jewelry gift sets, sampler boxes and gift cards. Everything can be wrapped with a handwritten note on request." }
